# EEB5300_FinalProject
This repository includes all the code that I ran in order to complete my final project for EEB 5300, Practical Genomics.
For this project I worked with three species, Litobothrium aenigmaticum, Litobothrium daileyi, and Litobothrium amplifica. In my code I used specific species codes: KJHRD for L. aenigmaticum, KJHRE for L. daileyi, and KJHRF for L. amplifica.
